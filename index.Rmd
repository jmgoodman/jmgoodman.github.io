My interest is in using data as a tool to answer research questions and test hypotheses. I recently joined the biostatistics faculty at Cleveland Clinic in the [Department of Quantitative Health Sciences](https://www.lerner.ccf.org/qhs/zabor/) with a joint appointment in the Taussig Cancer Institute. Previously, I worked for nine years as a research biostatistician  at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in the Department of Epidemiology & Biostatistics, where I worked primarily in breast and urologic cancers.

I graduated from the University of Minnesota with a MS in biostatistics in 2010 and from Columbia University with a DrPH in biostatistics in 2019.

I am an avid R enthusiast and an active member of [R Ladies](https://rladies.org/).
