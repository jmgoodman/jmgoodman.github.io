I am a neuroscientist interested in how the brain controls the movements of our hands and the role of sensory information in shaping those movements.<br><br>

I work as a post-doctoral researcher at the [German Primate Center](https://www.dpz.eu/en/home.html) (Deutsches Primatenzentrum) in the Neurobiology Laboratory headed by [Hans Scherberger](https://www.dpz.eu/en/unit/neurobiology.html). I am currently researching the topic of "Mirror Neurons" and their contribution, at the single-neuronal and population levels, to the neural processing underlying grasping.<br><br>

I received my Ph.D. in Computational Neuroscience in December 2018 from the University of Chicago, where I worked in the laboratory headed by [Sliman Bensmaia](http://bensmaialab.org/). I studied grasping, the cortical signals related to proprioception and motor control of the hand, and the perception of touch and proprioception in the hands.<br><br>

I graduated from Drexel University in 2013 with a BS and MS in Biomedical Engineering. There, I worked in the laboratory headed by [Karen Moxon ](https://moxonlab.bme.ucdavis.edu/) (currently UC Davis) on the feasibility of using epidural spinal cord stimulation in brain-computer interface applications.<br>
